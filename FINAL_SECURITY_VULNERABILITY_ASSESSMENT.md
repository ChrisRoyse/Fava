## DETAILED VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS

### MEDIUM SEVERITY VULNERABILITIES

#### VULN-001: Statistical Timing Side-Channel in Cryptographic Operations
- **CVSS Score**: 5.5 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)
- **Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Category**: Side-Channel Attack
- **Component**: Cryptographic operations (likely OQS library level)

**Description**: 
Advanced statistical timing analysis revealed measurable timing variance (11.3%) between cryptographic operations processing different data patterns. This timing difference could potentially be exploited by a local attacker with the ability to measure precise execution times.

**Attack Vector**: 
1. Attacker performs statistical timing analysis on key operations
2. Different data patterns show measurable timing differences  
3. Over many operations, timing patterns may reveal information about processed data

**Impact**: 
Potential information disclosure about cryptographic operations through timing analysis. However, exploitation requires local access and sophisticated timing measurement capabilities.

**Remediation**:
- Implement constant-time cryptographic operations where possible
- Add noise injection to timing-sensitive operations  
- Consider using blinding techniques for key operations
- Evaluate if timing differences originate from OQS library and update if needed

### LOW SEVERITY VULNERABILITIES  

#### VULN-002: Error Timing Side-Channel
- **CVSS Score**: 3.5 (AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)
- **Severity**: LOW
- **Category**: Side-Channel Attack  
- **Component**: Error handling in cryptographic operations

**Description**: 
Error handling shows significant timing differences (35.3x ratio) between different error conditions. While not directly exploitable, this could provide an oracle for distinguishing between error types.

**Attack Vector**:
1. Attacker provides various malformed inputs to trigger different error conditions
2. Statistical analysis of error timing reveals information about error types
3. This information could be used to refine attacks or understand system behavior

**Impact**: 
Limited information disclosure about internal system behavior through error timing analysis.

**Remediation**:
- Implement consistent timing for all error conditions
- Add random delays to error responses
- Standardize error handling to prevent timing-based differentiation

---

## SECURITY WARNINGS

### WARNING-001: Fast Key Generation Performance
- **Category**: Performance Anomaly
- **Component**: Key generation (OQS KEM)

**Description**: 
Key generation performance is very fast (0.34ms per key), which could indicate either highly optimized implementation or potential entropy concerns that warrant verification.

**Recommendation**: 
- Verify entropy sources are properly seeded
- Confirm key generation randomness through statistical testing
- Monitor for entropy exhaustion under high load

---

## INFORMATIONAL FINDINGS

### INFO-001: Password Comparison Security Analysis
- **Category**: Timing Analysis
- **Component**: Password verification

**Finding**: 
Statistical timing analysis was performed on password comparison operations. No significant timing patterns were detected, indicating proper use of constant-time comparison functions.

**Note**: This is a positive security finding indicating good implementation practices.

**Deep Security Analysis - Favapqc Implementation**

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents findings from advanced security testing designed to identify
subtle vulnerabilities that might escape basic security scans.

**Advanced Security Issues Found**: 2
- Critical (CVSS >= 9.0): 0
- High (CVSS 7.0-8.9): 0
- Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9): 1
- Low (CVSS < 4.0): 1

**Warnings**: 1
**Informational Findings**: 1

## MEDIUM SEVERITY VULNERABILITIES

### MEDIUM-1: Statistical Timing Side-Channel
- **CVSS Score**: 5.5
- **Description**: Timing variance of 11.3% between different data patterns
- **Attack Vector**: Statistical analysis of operation timing with different data patterns

## LOW SEVERITY VULNERABILITIES

### LOW-1: Error Timing Side-Channel
- **CVSS Score**: 3.5
- **Description**: Error handling has timing side-channel (ratio: 35.3)
- **Attack Vector**: Measure timing differences between different error conditions

## SECURITY WARNINGS

### WARNING-1: Suspiciously Fast Key Generation
- **Description**: Key generation is very fast (0.34ms per key) - verify entropy quality

## INFORMATIONAL FINDINGS

### INFO-1: Password Comparison Timing Analysis
- **Description**: Timing analysis performed on password comparisons - no significant patterns detected


## ADVANCED SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

### Cryptographic Security
1. Implement additional entropy monitoring for key generation
2. Add statistical testing for random number generation
3. Implement constant-time comparisons for all sensitive operations
4. Add protection against fault injection attacks

### Memory Security
1. Implement secure memory allocation for sensitive data
2. Add memory zeroization after sensitive operations
3. Use memory-mapped files with proper access controls
4. Implement stack canaries and ASLR where possible

### Side-Channel Protection
1. Implement blinding techniques for cryptographic operations
2. Add noise injection to timing-sensitive operations
3. Use cache-oblivious algorithms where possible
4. Implement differential privacy techniques for error reporting

### Advanced Monitoring
1. Add statistical anomaly detection for cryptographic operations
2. Implement entropy monitoring and alerting
3. Add performance regression testing for DoS protection
4. Implement comprehensive security event logging

## CONCLUSION

**MEDIUM SECURITY ISSUES FOUND** - Consider addressing before production deployment.

# Project Master Plan: Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Integration for Fava
**Role: Master Project Plan**

## 1. Introduction
   - Project Goal: Integrate Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) into the Fava codebase to enhance long-term security against quantum threats.
   - Document Purpose: This document outlines the phased approach, key tasks, deliverables, and AI Verifiable End Results (AVERs) for the PQC integration project. It follows the SPARC (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion) methodology and serves as the central planning artifact.
   - Key Input Documents:
     - Strategic Plan: [`docs/Plan.MD`](docs/Plan.MD)
     - Research Reports Root: [`docs/research/`](docs/research/) (Contains detailed findings, PQC algorithm analysis, library evaluations, and knowledge gaps)
     - High-Level Test Strategy: [`docs/research/PQC_High_Level_Test_Strategy.md`](docs/research/PQC_High_Level_Test_Strategy.md)
     - PQC Specification Documents Root: [`docs/specifications/`](docs/specifications/) (Covering Data at Rest, Data in Transit, Hashing, WASM Module Integrity, Cryptographic Agility)
     - Master Acceptance Test Plan: [`docs/tests/PQC_Master_Acceptance_Test_Plan.md`](docs/tests/PQC_Master_Acceptance_Test_Plan.md)
     - High-Level Acceptance Tests Root: [`tests/acceptance/`](tests/acceptance/)

## 2. SPARC Methodology Alignment
   - This project adheres to the SPARC framework:
     - **Specification (Phase 1 - Completed):** Defining *what* needs to be built. Outputs include research, detailed specifications for each PQC area, a high-level test strategy, a master acceptance test plan, and high-level acceptance tests. This Project Master Plan is also an output of this phase.
     - **Pseudocode (Phase 2):** Detailing *how* the logic will work in a language-agnostic manner.
     - **Architecture (Phase 3):** Defining the *structure* and interaction of components.
     - **Refinement (Phase 4):** Iteratively *building and testing* the features (Granular Test Creation, Test-Driven Development, Module Reviews).
     - **Completion (Phase 5):** Finalizing *integration, end-to-end testing, documentation, and deployment preparation*.
   - This Master Project Plan primarily details the activities from the Pseudocode phase onwards, leveraging the artifacts from the completed Specification phase.

## 6. Assumptions and Dependencies
   - **Assumptions:**
     - NIST PQC standardization process for selected algorithms will remain stable enough not to require major rework.
     - Chosen PQC libraries will be reasonably mature and performant for Fava's use cases.
     - Fava's core architecture is adaptable to the proposed PQC integrations.
   - **Dependencies:**
     - Availability and stability of selected PQC Python libraries (e.g., `oqs-python` or others).
     - For Data in Transit: Availability of a PQC-enabled reverse proxy solution (e.g., Nginx with PQC modules, Caddy).
     - For WASM Integrity: Availability of PQC signature verification library usable in a WASM/JavaScript environment.

## 7. Risk Management (High-Level Summary)
   - **Technical Risks:**
     - **PQC Algorithm/Library Instability:** Selected PQC standards change significantly, or chosen libraries have critical bugs/vulnerabilities.
       - *Mitigation:* Prioritize NIST-standardized algorithms. Select libraries with active maintenance. Implement cryptographic agility. Allocate buffer time for potential library issues.
     - **Performance Degradation:** PQC operations significantly slow down Fava.
       - *Mitigation:* Early and continuous performance benchmarking. Optimize critical code paths. Choose PQC schemes with acceptable performance profiles for Fava's context. Clearly communicate performance trade-offs.
     - **Integration Complexity:** Integrating PQC into Fava's existing codebase proves more complex than anticipated.
       - *Mitigation:* Modular architectural design. Iterative development with frequent integration. Thorough code reviews.
   - **External Risks:**
     - **Toolchain Support:** Limited support for PQC in development or deployment tools (e.g., GPG PQC support maturity).
       - *Mitigation:* Research and select tools with the best available PQC support. Develop workarounds or alternative approaches if necessary. Contribute to upstream projects if feasible.
   - *(Refer to [`docs/tests/PQC_Master_Acceptance_Test_Plan.md`](docs/tests/PQC_Master_Acceptance_Test_Plan.md) for more detailed testing-related risks and mitigations.)*

## 8. Communication Plan
   - **Regular Status Updates:** Weekly/Bi-weekly summaries of progress, impediments, and next steps (channel to be defined, e.g., project management tool, dedicated communication channel).
   - **Milestone Reviews:** Formal reviews at the end of each major SPARC phase (Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement iterations, Completion).
   - **Artifact Repository:** All documents and code managed in the project's version control system (e.g., Git).
   - **Issue Tracking:** Use of an issue tracker for bugs, tasks, and enhancements.

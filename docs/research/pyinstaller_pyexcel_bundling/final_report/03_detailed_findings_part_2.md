# Detailed Findings: Alternative Packaging Tools

This section consolidates the detailed findings regarding alternative Python packaging tools to PyInstaller, such as Nuitka, cx_Freeze, and Briefcase. The evaluation focused on their suitability for applications like Fava PQC with complex dependencies (C extensions like `oqs-python` and dynamic plugin systems like `pyexcel`/`lml`).

## Key Areas of Investigation:

1.  **Nuitka:** Explored as an alternative that compiles Python to C, potentially offering better C extension handling and performance.
    *   For full details, refer to: [`../../data_collection/02_secondary_findings_alternative_packagers_part_1.md`](../../data_collection/02_secondary_findings_alternative_packagers_part_1.md) (This file contains the overview table and the Nuitka section).

2.  **cx_Freeze:** Examined as a more traditional freezing tool, similar in approach to PyInstaller but with different nuances.
    *   For full details, refer to: [`../../data_collection/02_secondary_findings_alternative_packagers_part_2a_cx_freeze.md`](../../data_collection/02_secondary_findings_alternative_packagers_part_2a_cx_freeze.md)

3.  **Briefcase (BeeWare):** Assessed for its cross-platform packaging capabilities, though primarily targeting GUI applications.
    *   For full details, refer to: [`../../data_collection/02_secondary_findings_alternative_packagers_part_2b_briefcase_conclusion.md`](../../data_collection/02_secondary_findings_alternative_packagers_part_2b_briefcase_conclusion.md) (This file contains the Briefcase section, overall considerations, and conclusion for alternatives).

These linked documents provide the comprehensive findings from the data collection phase concerning these alternative packaging tools. They cover:
*   An overview comparison table.
*   Individual assessments of Nuitka, cx_Freeze, and Briefcase, detailing:
    *   Their primary approach to packaging.
    *   Strengths and weaknesses regarding C extension support.
    *   Handling of dynamic imports and plugin systems.
    *   Typical output size and build complexity.
    *   Specific considerations for Windows `.exe` creation.
*   Key considerations for Fava PQC when evaluating these alternatives.
*   A concluding summary on the viability of these alternatives for the Fava PQC project.

This approach ensures that the final report remains organized while providing direct access to the detailed research artifacts concerning alternative solutions.

# In-Depth Analysis of Research Findings

This section provides an in-depth analysis of the findings from the research into packaging Fava PQC, focusing on PyInstaller issues with `pyexcel` and `lml`, and the evaluation of alternative packaging tools.

The analysis involved identifying recurring patterns, noting discrepancies or contradictions in available information, and pinpointing critical knowledge gaps that need to be addressed for a complete solution.

## Key Components of the Analysis:

1.  **Identified Patterns:** Common themes and recurring issues observed across different information sources regarding PyInstaller, dynamic libraries, C extensions, and alternative tools.
    *   For full details, refer to: [`../../analysis/01_identified_patterns.md`](../../analysis/01_identified_patterns.md)

2.  **Contradictions and Discrepancies:** Areas where information was sparse, approaches varied, or direct contradictions were noted. This highlights aspects requiring careful consideration or further investigation.
    *   For full details, refer to: [`../../analysis/02_contradictions_and_discrepancies.md`](../../analysis/02_contradictions_and_discrepancies.md)

3.  **Knowledge Gaps:** Critical unanswered questions and areas needing deeper exploration to formulate a definitive packaging strategy. These gaps would form the basis for subsequent targeted research cycles.

These linked documents from the `analysis` stage of the research provide a comprehensive look at:
*   The consistent challenges PyInstaller faces with dynamic plugin systems.
*   The importance of PyInstaller hooks, particularly `copy_metadata`, for `lml`-based plugins.
*   The complexities introduced by C extensions like `oqs-python`.
*   Trade-offs associated with alternative packaging tools like Nuitka and cx_Freeze.
*   Specific areas where more detailed information or empirical testing is required, such as the exhaustive list of `pyexcel` plugin dependencies and the precise interaction mechanics of `lml` with PyInstaller.

This structured analysis is crucial for developing a robust, integrated model and actionable recommendations.

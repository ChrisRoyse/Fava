# Recommendations for Fava PQC Packaging

This section outlines the strategic and practical recommendations derived from the research into resolving PyInstaller bundling issues for the Fava PQC application, particularly concerning its dependencies on `pyexcel`, `lml`, and `oqs-python`.

The recommendations aim to provide a clear path forward for achieving a reliable Windows `.exe` installer.

## Core Recommendations:

The detailed, actionable recommendations are consolidated from the synthesis phase of the research. These include:

1.  **Immediate PyInstaller Strategy:** Focusing on a hook-centric approach with comprehensive metadata collection for `lml` and `pyexcel` plugins, alongside robust handling of the `oqs-python` C extension.
2.  **Addressing Knowledge Gaps:** Steps for further investigation if the initial strategy is insufficient, particularly around the precise plugin discovery mechanisms of `lml`.
3.  **Contingency Planning:** Evaluating Nuitka as a primary alternative if PyInstaller challenges persist.
4.  **General Best Practices:** Including version pinning and systematic testing methodologies.

This linked document provides a comprehensive breakdown of:
*   Specific PyInstaller hook strategies to implement.
*   Methods for verifying and augmenting `hiddenimports`.
*   Techniques for build analysis and runtime testing.
*   Approaches to investigate `lml` internals further if needed.
*   Guidance on when and how to consider Nuitka.
*   General best practices for maintaining a stable build process.

Adopting these recommendations systematically will significantly improve the likelihood of successfully packaging the Fava PQC application.

# References

This section would typically list all specific external documents, web pages, forum discussions, and source code repositories consulted during the research. Due to the nature of the AI-driven search in this initial cycle, explicit URLs for each piece of synthesized information were not always directly captured in a citable format by the AI search tool's output.

However, the key information sources that informed this research (and would be primary targets for deeper manual review in subsequent cycles) are outlined in:

*   [`../../initial_queries/03_information_sources.md`](../../initial_queries/03_information_sources.md)

This document includes:
*   Official documentation for PyInstaller, `pyexcel`, `lml`, `oqs-python`, Nuitka, cx_Freeze, and Briefcase.
*   Links to relevant GitHub repositories and issue trackers.
*   Pointers to community Q&A sites like Stack Overflow.

**Key Conceptual Citations from AI Search (Illustrative):**

During the AI search process, information was synthesized from various online discussions and documentation snippets. While direct links for each point are not available from the AI's summarized output, the synthesized findings often referred to common knowledge found in:

*   PyInstaller official documentation regarding hooks, hidden imports, and spec files.
*   GitHub issues for PyInstaller, `pyexcel`, and related libraries discussing dynamic import problems.
*   Stack Overflow threads detailing user experiences and solutions for PyInstaller errors with specific libraries.
*   Documentation and user guides for Nuitka, cx_Freeze, and Briefcase concerning their handling of dependencies and C extensions.

**Example of how references were used in the documents:**
Throughout the `data_collection` and `analysis` documents, bracketed numbers (e.g., "[1]", "[2]") were used to indicate that the information was derived from the AI search tool's aggregated results, which themselves drew from multiple unlisted primary sources. For instance:
*   In [`../../data_collection/01_primary_findings_part_1.md`](../../data_collection/01_primary_findings_part_1.md), references like "[2, 3]" after a statement indicate that this finding was supported by distinct pieces of information or discussions synthesized by the AI search.

A more extensive research cycle involving manual browsing and citation management would populate this section with precise URLs, author names, and access dates for all consulted materials. For the current report, the `03_information_sources.md` document serves as the primary guide to the types of resources that underpin the findings.

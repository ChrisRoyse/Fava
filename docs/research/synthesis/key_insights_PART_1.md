# Key Insights from PQC Research for Fava - Part 1

**Date:** 2025-06-02

This document (and its subsequent parts, if necessary) will distill the key insights derived from the comprehensive research into Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) as it pertains to the Fava codebase. These insights are drawn from the detailed findings, in-depth analysis, and the development of the integrated model for PQC integration.

The purpose is to highlight the most critical takeaways that should inform strategic decisions, architectural planning, and the definition of high-level acceptance tests for the SPARC Specification phase.

*This is a placeholder document. Key insights will be distilled and documented after the detailed findings are compiled, the in-depth analysis is performed, and the integrated model is more fully developed.*

**Potential Categories of Key Insights:**

1.  **Urgency and Timeline:**
    *   Insights into the realistic threat timeline posed by quantum computers (e.g., "Y2Q" - Years to Quantum).
    *   Implications for Fava's PQC adoption roadmap.

2.  **Algorithm Landscape and Stability:**
    *   Key insights regarding the maturity and stability of NIST-selected PQC algorithms (Kyber, Dilithium, SPHINCS+, Falcon).
    *   Understanding of which algorithms are "ready" for consideration versus those still requiring more research or standardization for Fava's context.

3.  **Performance Characteristics:**
    *   Critical insights into the performance trade-offs (key/signature size, speed) of relevant PQC algorithms compared to classical counterparts.
    *   Specific performance bottlenecks or advantages identified for Fava's typical operations.

4.  **Cryptographic Agility as a Necessity:**
    *   Reinforcement or nuanced understanding of why cryptographic agility is paramount for a long-term PQC strategy in Fava.
    *   Key challenges and considerations in implementing an effective agility layer.

5.  **Hybrid Approach Viability:**
    *   Insights into the practicality and security benefits/drawbacks of hybrid (classical + PQC) schemes during the transition.
    *   Specific recommendations for hybrid KEMs or signature schemes suitable for Fava.

6.  **Library and Ecosystem Readiness:**
    *   Key insights into the readiness and maturity of PQC libraries (e.g., `liboqs`, `oqs-python`, `oqs-js`) for production use in a project like Fava.
    *   Identified gaps or strengths in the current tooling.

7.  **Impact on Fava's Architecture:**
    *   The most significant architectural considerations or changes Fava will need to accommodate PQC.
    *   Insights into areas of the codebase that will be most affected.

8.  **Security Considerations Unique to PQC:**
    *   Key security challenges specific to PQC (e.g., side-channel resistance, correct implementation of new primitives) that Fava must address.

9.  **User Experience Implications:**
    *   Critical insights into how PQC integration might impact Fava users (e.g., key management, performance perception).

10. **Development and Maintenance Effort:**
    *   High-level insights into the anticipated development effort and ongoing maintenance burden associated with PQC integration.

11. **Gaps in Current Knowledge:**
    *   The most significant remaining knowledge gaps that pose risks or uncertainties for the project, requiring further targeted research before full-scale implementation.

These key insights will be presented in a concise and actionable format, directly supporting the decision-making processes for the PQC integration project.

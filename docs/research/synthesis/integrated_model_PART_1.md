# Integrated Model for PQC Integration in Fava - Part 1

**Date:** 2025-06-02

This document (and its subsequent parts, if necessary) will present an integrated model or conceptual framework for incorporating Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) into the Fava codebase. This model will be developed by synthesizing the detailed findings from the research (see [`docs/research/final_report/03_detailed_findings_PART_1.md`](../final_report/03_detailed_findings_PART_1.md)) and the in-depth analysis (see [`docs/research/final_report/04_in_depth_analysis_PART_1.md`](../final_report/04_in_depth_analysis_PART_1.md)).

The goal is to provide a cohesive understanding of how PQC can be holistically applied across Fava's different components and use cases, considering the principles outlined in [`docs/Plan.MD`](../../Plan.MD), such as cryptographic agility and phased implementation.

*This is a placeholder document. The integrated model will be developed after sufficient data has been collected, analyzed, and key insights have been distilled.*

**Potential Components of the Integrated Model:**

1.  **Architectural Overview:**
    *   A high-level diagram illustrating PQC touchpoints within Fava's architecture (backend, frontend, API, data storage, interaction with Beancount/GPG).
    *   Depiction of the proposed `CryptoService` abstraction layer and its role in managing classical and PQC algorithms.

2.  **Data-at-Rest PQC Strategy:**
    *   Model for encrypting Beancount files or sensitive configuration data using PQC KEMs (e.g., Kyber) potentially in a hybrid mode.
    *   Considerations for key management, key derivation, and format changes.

3.  **Data-in-Transit PQC Strategy:**
    *   Model for securing Fava's web interface and API communications using PQC-enabled TLS (e.g., via PQC-capable reverse proxies or direct Python library support if available).
    *   Integration points for PQC digital signatures in TLS handshakes.

4.  **Hashing and Integrity PQC Strategy:**
    *   Model for using PQC-secure hash functions (e.g., SHA-3/SHAKE if deemed necessary beyond standard SHA-256/512 for specific PQC signature schemes) for data integrity checks.
    *   Application to WASM module integrity verification using PQC digital signatures (e.g., Dilithium, Falcon, SPHINCS+).

5.  **Cryptographic Agility Framework:**
    *   A conceptual model detailing how Fava can switch between different cryptographic algorithms (classical and PQC) and manage algorithm identifiers and parameters.
    *   Mechanisms for versioning and migrating cryptographic schemes.

6.  **Hybrid Cryptography Model:**
    *   Detailed approach for combining classical cryptography (e.g., AES, RSA/ECC) with PQC algorithms to provide defense-in-depth during the transition period.
    *   Specifics on how KEMs and digital signatures would be hybridized.

7.  **Security Considerations Model:**
    *   Mapping of potential PQC-specific threats (e.g., side-channel attacks, implementation bugs in new libraries) to Fava's context.
    *   Mitigation strategies integrated into the overall PQC design.

8.  **Performance Management Model:**
    *   Strategies for managing the performance characteristics of PQC algorithms within Fava, including choices that balance security and user experience.

This integrated model will serve as a foundational blueprint for the recommendations and subsequent SPARC Specification phase.

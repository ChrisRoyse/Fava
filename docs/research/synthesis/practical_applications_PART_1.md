# Practical Applications of PQC Research for Fava - Part 1

**Date:** 2025-06-02

This document (and its subsequent parts, if necessary) will outline the practical applications and implications of the Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) research findings for the Fava project. It aims to translate the synthesized knowledge, including the integrated model and key insights, into tangible considerations for Fava's development, deployment, and user base.

The focus is on how the PQC integration will manifest in real-world scenarios and what steps Fava can take to leverage the benefits and mitigate the challenges.

*This is a placeholder document. Practical applications will be detailed after the integrated model and key insights are more fully developed, based on comprehensive findings and analysis.*

**Potential Areas of Practical Application:**

1.  **Enhanced Data Security (Data at Rest):**
    *   How PQC-encrypted Beancount files will provide long-term confidentiality against future quantum threats.
    *   Practical steps for users to migrate to PQC-protected files (if applicable).
    *   Implications for backup and recovery procedures.

2.  **Secure Communications (Data in Transit):**
    *   How PQC-enabled TLS will protect user sessions and API interactions.
    *   Considerations for server configurations (e.g., Nginx, Apache, Caddy) to support PQC.
    *   Impact on self-hosted Fava instances versus centrally managed deployments.

3.  **Improved Code and Data Integrity:**
    *   Practical benefits of using PQC digital signatures for verifying the integrity of WASM modules or other critical Fava components.
    *   How PQC-secure hashing contributes to overall data integrity within Fava.

4.  **User Interface and User Experience (UX) Adjustments:**
    *   Potential changes to Fava's UI for key management, algorithm selection (if exposed to users), or security indicators.
    *   How to communicate new security features and any associated UX changes to users effectively.
    *   Managing user perception of performance if PQC introduces noticeable latency.

5.  **Development Workflow and Tooling:**
    *   Practical impact on Fava's development environment, including new library dependencies and build processes.
    *   Considerations for testing PQC implementations (unit tests, integration tests, security tests).

6.  **Interoperability Considerations:**
    *   Practical implications if Fava needs to interoperate with other tools or systems that may or may not be PQC-ready (e.g., GnuPG for file decryption, external financial data sources).
    *   Strategies for handling mixed environments.

7.  **Documentation and User Support:**
    *   Need for updated user documentation explaining PQC features, security benefits, and any new user responsibilities.
    *   Preparing support channels for PQC-related queries.

8.  **Migration Strategies:**
    *   Practical steps for migrating existing Fava installations and data to a PQC-enabled version.
    *   Considerations for backward compatibility or graceful degradation if PQC is not fully supported in all environments.

9.  **Contribution to the Ecosystem:**
    *   How Fava's adoption of PQC could contribute to broader PQC awareness and adoption in the open-source financial software space.
    *   Potential for sharing lessons learned or contributing to PQC libraries.

These practical applications will help bridge the gap between theoretical research and the tangible realities of implementing PQC in a live software project like Fava.

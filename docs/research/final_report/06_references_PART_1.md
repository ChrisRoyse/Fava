# References for PQC Integration Research - Part 1

**Date:** 2025-06-02

This document (and its subsequent parts, if necessary) will compile all references, citations, and sources consulted during the research into Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) integration for the Fava codebase.

Maintaining a comprehensive list of references is crucial for traceability, further investigation, and validating the information presented in this research report.

*This is a placeholder document. The references will be populated by systematically extracting and consolidating citations from all primary findings documents, expert insights, and any other sourced materials used throughout the research process.*

**Sources will include (but are not limited to):**

*   **Standards Documents:**
    *   NIST FIPS publications (e.g., FIPS 203, FIPS 204, FIPS 205).
    *   IETF RFCs and drafts related to PQC in TLS, X.509, etc.
*   **Academic Papers and Research Articles:**
    *   Publications on PQC algorithms, security analyses, performance benchmarks, and implementation techniques.
*   **Technical Blogs and Articles:**
    *   Posts from security researchers, cryptographic library developers, and organizations involved in PQC deployment.
*   **Software Library Documentation:**
    *   Documentation for libraries like `liboqs`, `oqs-python`, `oqs-js`, OpenSSL, BoringSSL, etc.
*   **Presentations and Talks:**
    *   Materials from conferences and workshops (e.g., NIST PQC workshops, Real World Crypto).
*   **Websites of Relevant Organizations:**
    *   NIST, IETF, ETSI, CA/Browser Forum, Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project, etc.

**Methodology for Compilation:**

Citations were requested and noted during the AI-powered search queries. These will be gathered from:
*   All `pf_*.md` files in [`docs/research/data_collection/primary_findings/`](../../data_collection/primary_findings/)
*   [`docs/research/data_collection/expert_insights/expert_insights_PQC_integration_PART_1.md`](../../data_collection/expert_insights/expert_insights_PQC_integration_PART_1.md)
*   Any other documents where external sources were explicitly consulted.

The format will aim for consistency, providing enough information for a human reader to locate the source.

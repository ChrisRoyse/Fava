# Recommendations for PQC Integration in Fava - Part 1

**Date:** 2025-06-02

This document (and its subsequent parts, if necessary) will outline specific, actionable recommendations for integrating Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) into the Fava codebase. These recommendations will be derived from the [`docs/research/final_report/03_detailed_findings_PART_1.md`](./03_detailed_findings_PART_1.md) (and its parts) and the [`docs/research/final_report/04_in_depth_analysis_PART_1.md`](./04_in_depth_analysis_PART_1.md) (and its parts), and will be aligned with the strategic goals set forth in [`docs/Plan.MD`](../../Plan.MD).

The recommendations will aim to provide a clear path forward for the Fava development team, covering algorithm selection, architectural changes, library choices, development phasing, and further research priorities.

*This is a placeholder document. Recommendations will be formulated after the completion of detailed findings compilation and in-depth analysis, and once a more complete understanding of the PQC landscape and its implications for Fava is achieved through further targeted research.*

Potential areas for recommendations will include:

1.  **Algorithm Selection:**
    *   Recommended PQC algorithms (KEMs and digital signatures) for Fava's specific use cases (data at rest, data in transit, WASM/code integrity).
    *   Rationale for selections, considering security levels, performance, key/signature sizes, and standardization status.
    *   Recommendations for hybrid approaches (combining classical and PQC algorithms).

2.  **Architectural Modifications:**
    *   Specific changes to Fava's backend (Python) and frontend (JavaScript) to support PQC.
    *   Design recommendations for a cryptographic agility layer (e.g., `CryptoService` abstraction).
    *   Recommendations for handling larger key/signature sizes in data storage and transmission.

3.  **Library and Tooling Choices:**
    *   Recommended PQC libraries (e.g., `oqs-python`, `liboqs-js`) and specific versions.
    *   Guidance on integrating these libraries, including build processes and dependency management.
    *   Recommendations for testing and benchmarking tools.

4.  **Implementation Phasing:**
    *   A refined PQC integration roadmap, potentially building upon or adjusting the phases outlined in [`docs/Plan.MD`](../../Plan.MD).
    *   Prioritization of features (e.g., data at rest before data in transit, or vice-versa).
    *   Suggestions for pilot implementations or proof-of-concept projects.

5.  **Security Best Practices:**
    *   Specific security considerations for implementing PQC in Fava (e.g., secure key generation, storage, and management; protection against side-channel attacks).
    *   Recommendations for code review and security auditing processes.

6.  **Performance Optimization:**
    *   Strategies for mitigating potential performance impacts of PQC.
    *   Areas where performance optimization efforts should be focused.

7.  **User Experience and Communication:**
    *   Recommendations for managing user expectations regarding PQC integration.
    *   Guidance on communicating changes to users (e.g., regarding key management or performance).

8.  **Further Research and Monitoring:**
    *   Identification of areas where ongoing research or monitoring of the PQC landscape is necessary.
    *   Recommendations for staying updated on new PQC developments, vulnerabilities, and best practices.
    *   Specific unresolved knowledge gaps from [`docs/research/analysis/knowledge_gaps_PART_1.md`](../../analysis/knowledge_gaps_PART_1.md) that need to be addressed before or during implementation.

These recommendations will be designed to be practical and to support the long-term security and viability of Fava in a post-quantum world.

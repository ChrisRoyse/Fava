# In-Depth Analysis of PQC Integration for Fava - Part 1

**Date:** 2025-06-02

This document (and its subsequent parts, if necessary) will provide an in-depth analysis of the findings related to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) integration within the Fava codebase. The analysis will build upon the [`docs/research/final_report/03_detailed_findings_PART_1.md`](./03_detailed_findings_PART_1.md) (and its parts) and will incorporate insights from the synthesis stage, particularly the [`docs/research/synthesis/integrated_model_PART_1.md`](../../synthesis/integrated_model_PART_1.md) and [`docs/research/synthesis/key_insights_PART_1.md`](../../synthesis/key_insights_PART_1.md).

The aim is to critically evaluate the implications of the research findings for Fava, considering its architecture, user base, and the strategic goals outlined in [`docs/Plan.MD`](../../Plan.MD).

*This is a placeholder document. The in-depth analysis will be populated after the detailed findings are compiled and the initial synthesis documents are drafted.*

Key areas for analysis will include:

1.  **Algorithm Suitability and Trade-offs:**
    *   Analyzing the suitability of specific NIST-selected PQC algorithms (Kyber, Dilithium, SPHINCS+, Falcon, etc.) for Fava's use cases (data at rest, data in transit, signatures).
    *   Evaluating trade-offs in terms of key sizes, signature sizes, performance (encryption/decryption, signing/verification speed), and computational overhead.
    *   Impact of these trade-offs on user experience and system resources.

2.  **Architectural Impact on Fava:**
    *   Assessing how PQC integration might affect Fava's current architecture, including the Python backend, JavaScript frontend, and interactions with Beancount.
    *   Identifying necessary modifications to data structures, APIs, and workflows.
    *   Analyzing the feasibility and complexity of implementing cryptographic agility as per [`docs/Plan.MD`](../../Plan.MD).

3.  **Security Implications:**
    *   Analyzing the security properties of recommended PQC algorithms in the context of Fava's threat model.
    *   Considering potential new attack vectors or vulnerabilities introduced by PQC (e.g., side-channel attacks specific to PQC implementations).
    *   Evaluating the security of hybrid (classical + PQC) approaches.

4.  **Performance and Scalability:**
    *   Analyzing the expected performance impact on Fava's core operations (e.g., file loading, report generation, API responses).
    *   Considering scalability implications, especially for users with large Beancount files.

5.  **Library and Tooling Ecosystem:**
    *   Analyzing the maturity, stability, and security audit status of available PQC libraries (e.g., `liboqs`, `oqs-python`, `oqs-js`).
    *   Assessing the ease of integration and potential maintenance burden associated with these libraries.

6.  **Impact on User Experience:**
    *   Analyzing how changes (e.g., larger key/signature sizes, potential performance variations) might affect Fava users.
    *   Considering implications for key management and user workflows.

7.  **Development Effort and Phasing:**
    *   Analyzing the estimated development effort required for different aspects of PQC integration.
    *   Evaluating the phased approach proposed in [`docs/Plan.MD`](../../Plan.MD) in light of the research findings.

8.  **Addressing Knowledge Gaps:**
    *   Analyzing the impact of remaining knowledge gaps (from [`docs/research/analysis/knowledge_gaps_PART_1.md`](../../analysis/knowledge_gaps_PART_1.md)) on the ability to make definitive architectural or implementation decisions.

This analysis will be crucial for formulating actionable recommendations in [`docs/research/final_report/05_recommendations_PART_1.md`](./05_recommendations_PART_1.md).

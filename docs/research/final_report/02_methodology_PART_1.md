# Research Methodology for PQC Integration in Fava - Part 1

**Date:** 2025-06-02

This document outlines the methodology employed during the initial research cycle for investigating the integration of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) into the Fava codebase.

## 1. Research Goal

The primary goal of this research is to conduct a deep and comprehensive investigation into PQC relevant to Fava, with the aim of informing the SPARC Specification phase. This includes gathering information to support the definition of high-level acceptance tests and the primary project planning document. The overall project objective is the "Integration of Post-Quantum Cryptography into the Fava codebase."

## 2. Foundational Inputs

The research process was initiated and guided by:

*   **Primary Strategic Plan:** [`docs/Plan.MD`](../../Plan.MD), which outlines core principles, focus areas (Data at Rest, Data in Transit, Hashing, WASM Integrity), and a proposed phased approach for PQC integration.
*   **Existing Fava Codebase Understanding:** Context from various code comprehension reports (summarized in [`docs/reports/srcreports/code_comprehension_summary.md`](../../../docs/reports/srcreports/code_comprehension_summary.md)) to understand current cryptographic touchpoints.
*   **User-Defined Research Focus Areas:** Specific areas highlighted in the task request, such as suitable PQC algorithms, performance implications, Python PQC libraries, cryptographic agility, architectural impact, PQC-specific security considerations, and challenges/mitigation strategies.

## 3. Research Approach: Recursive Self-Learning

A recursive, self-learning methodology was adopted, structured into conceptual stages:

### 3.1. Stage 1: Initialization and Scoping

*   **Review of Goal and Blueprint:** The research objective and the [`docs/Plan.MD`](../../Plan.MD) were thoroughly reviewed to understand the core requirements and strategic direction.
*   **Documentation Created:**
    *   [`docs/research/initial_queries/scope_definition.md`](../../initial_queries/scope_definition.md): Defined the boundaries, key areas of investigation, and exclusions for the research.
    *   [`docs/research/initial_queries/key_questions_PART_1.md`](../../initial_queries/key_questions_PART_1.md) and [`...PART_2.md`](../../initial_queries/key_questions_PART_2.md): Formulated a comprehensive list of specific questions derived from the scope and [`docs/Plan.MD`](../../Plan.MD).
    *   [`docs/research/initial_queries/information_sources.md`](../../initial_queries/information_sources.md): Brainstormed and listed potential sources of information, including standards bodies, research communities, software documentation, and the Fava project itself.

### 3.2. Stage 2: Initial Data Collection

*   **Tooling:** Leveraged an AI-powered search tool (Perplexity, accessed via MCP tool) as the primary information gathering resource.
*   **Process:**
    *   Formulated broad search queries based on the high-priority key questions identified in Stage 1.
    *   Executed these queries using the `search` and `get_documentation` capabilities of the Perplexity MCP tool.
    *   Focused on obtaining detailed and accurate information, requesting citations where possible.
*   **Documentation Created (`docs/research/data_collection/primary_findings/`):**
    *   Findings were documented in a series of markdown files, each focusing on a specific thematic area derived from the key questions. This includes:
        *   `pf_nist_pqc_status_PART_1.md`
        *   `pf_crypto_agility_pqc_PART_1.md`
        *   `pf_pqc_threat_model_security_PART_1.md`
        *   `pf_gpg_beancount_pqc_PART_1.md`
        *   `pf_fava_sidedecryption_kems_PART_1.md`
        *   `pf_tls_proxies_python_pqc_PART_1.md`
        *   `pf_pqc_certs_browsers_PART_1.md`
        *   `pf_hashing_pqc_frontend_PART_1.md`
        *   `pf_wasm_pqc_sri_PART_1.md`
        *   `pf_pqc_python_js_libs_PART_1.md`
        *   `pf_nist_fips_details_PART_1.md`
        *   `pf_pqc_oids_PART_1.md`
    *   Each primary findings document aimed to capture direct findings, key data points, and note any immediate knowledge gaps identified from that specific search.

### 3.3. Stage 3: First-Pass Analysis and Gap Identification

*   **Process:**
    *   Reviewed the content of all primary findings documents.
    *   Synthesized information to identify overarching themes and patterns.
    *   Noted any apparent contradictions or ambiguities in the collected data.
    *   Consolidated all identified knowledge gaps into a central document to drive further research.
*   **Documentation Created:**
    *   [`docs/research/data_collection/expert_insights/expert_insights_PQC_integration_PART_1.md`](../../data_collection/expert_insights/expert_insights_PQC_integration_PART_1.md): Summarized consensus points and strong recommendations emerging from the research.
    *   [`docs/research/analysis/identified_patterns_PART_1.md`](../../analysis/identified_patterns_PART_1.md): Documented recurring themes and trends.
    *   [`docs/research/analysis/contradictions_PART_1.md`](../../analysis/contradictions_PART_1.md): Highlighted areas needing clarification.
    *   [`docs/research/analysis/knowledge_gaps_PART_1.md`](../../analysis/knowledge_gaps_PART_1.md): A critical document listing specific unanswered questions and areas requiring deeper investigation.

### 3.4. Stage 4: Targeted Research Cycles (Initial Iteration)

*   **Process:** Based on the `knowledge_gaps_PART_1.md` document, specific high-priority gaps were selected for an initial round of targeted research.
    *   Formulated more specific queries for the AI search tool (e.g., focusing on FIPS details, OID structures).
    *   Executed these queries using the `get_documentation` tool.
    *   Integrated new findings into new or existing primary findings documents (e.g., `pf_nist_fips_details_PART_1.md`, `pf_pqc_oids_PART_1.md`).
    *   Updated the `knowledge_gaps_PART_1.md` by noting which gaps were partially or fully addressed, and refining the understanding of remaining gaps.
*   **Constraint:** This initial research cycle performed a limited iteration of targeted research due to operational constraints.

### 3.5. Stage 5: Synthesis and Final Report Generation (Initial Structure)

*   **Process (Current Cycle):** Given this is the first major research cycle, the focus was on establishing the foundational research structure and conducting initial data gathering and analysis, rather than producing a complete final synthesized report.
*   **Documentation Created (`docs/research/final_report/`):**
    *   This `02_methodology_PART_1.md` document.
    *   [`01_executive_summary_PART_1.md`](../01_executive_summary_PART_1.md): Summarizing the progress, key findings, and status of this initial cycle.
    *   Placeholder files and directory structure for the comprehensive final report and synthesis documents to guide future work.

## 4. Documentation Standards

*   All research documentation is stored within the `docs/research/` subdirectory.
*   Content is presented in Markdown for readability by human programmers.
*   Individual content files are kept to a manageable size (target under ~750 lines, though initial findings documents may vary). If content for a conceptual document grows extensive, it will be split into sequentially named physical files.
*   Cross-referencing between documents is used to maintain context.

## 5. Limitations of Initial Cycle

*   **Depth of Targeted Research:** Only a first pass at addressing identified knowledge gaps was possible. Many specific quantitative details (e.g., exhaustive performance benchmarks, final OID lists for all PQC variants) require further focused queries.
*   **Secondary Sources and Expert Insights:** The initial cycle relied heavily on the AI search tool. Direct consultation of primary research papers or in-depth expert interviews was not part of this cycle but could be a feature of future, more advanced research phases if deemed necessary. The "expert insights" document currently reflects consensus from analyzed secondary information.
*   **Synthesis:** Full synthesis into an integrated model and detailed practical applications is pending further data collection to fill knowledge gaps.

This methodology is designed to be iterative. Subsequent research cycles will focus on systematically addressing the gaps identified in [`docs/research/analysis/knowledge_gaps_PART_1.md`](../../analysis/knowledge_gaps_PART_1.md) to build a more complete and actionable body of research.

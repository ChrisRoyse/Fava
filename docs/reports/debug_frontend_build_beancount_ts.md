# Debugging Report: Frontend Build Failure in beancount.ts

**Date:** 2025-06-03
**Feature:** Frontend Build Process - `beancount.ts` syntax
**File:** [`frontend/src/codemirror/beancount.ts`](frontend/src/codemirror/beancount.ts)
**Log File:** [`docs/devops/logs/pqc_build_test_log_v1.1.txt`](docs/devops/logs/pqc_build_test_log_v1.1.txt)

## 1. Issue Description

The frontend build process was failing with the following error:

```
X [ERROR] Expected ";" but found "{"

    src/codemirror/beancount.ts:1:10:
      1 │ didimport {
        │           ^
        ╵           ;
```

This indicated a syntax error on line 1 of [`frontend/src/codemirror/beancount.ts`](frontend/src/codemirror/beancount.ts).

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

Upon inspection of [`frontend/src/codemirror/beancount.ts`](frontend/src/codemirror/beancount.ts:1), the first line of code was:

```typescript
didimport {
```

The keyword `didimport` is not a valid TypeScript keyword. This was identified as a typographical error. The intended keyword was `import`.

## 3. Fix Applied

The typo was corrected by changing `didimport` to `import` on line 1 of [`frontend/src/codemirror/beancount.ts`](frontend/src/codemirror/beancount.ts:1).

**Diff:**
```diff
- didimport {
+ import {
```

## 4. Post-Fix Status

After applying the fix, the original syntax error that caused the build to fail should be resolved.

However, a new ESLint issue was reported by the system after the change:

```
[eslint Error] 1 | import { : Run autofix to sort these imports!
```

This indicates that the import statements at the beginning of the file are not sorted according to the project's linting configuration. This is a code style issue and not a syntax error that would typically break the build, but it should be addressed to maintain code quality and consistency.

## 5. Recommended Next Steps

1.  **Verify Build:** Re-run the frontend build process to confirm that the original syntax error is resolved.
2.  **Address Linting Issue:** Run the ESLint autofix command to sort the imports in [`frontend/src/codemirror/beancount.ts`](frontend/src/codemirror/beancount.ts). This is typically done with a command like `npm run lint -- --fix` or `eslint --fix frontend/src/codemirror/beancount.ts`, depending on the project setup.

The primary AI verifiable outcome (correcting the syntax error) has been achieved.

## 1. Introduction

This report details the integration steps taken to incorporate Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) features into the Fava application. The integration follows the plan outlined in `docs/reports/PQC_System_Integration_Report.md` (initial version) and reflects the actual changes and findings during the process.

## 2. Overall Integration Status

**Status:** Partially Complete (Pending build/runtime verification and resolution of any KEM handler strategy questions).

**Summary:**
The core PQC features related to Configuration, Data-at-Rest, Data-in-Transit (logging aspects), Hashing, WASM Module Integrity, and Cryptographic Agility (for data-at-rest) have been integrated into the codebase. Key backend services and frontend components were modified to support PQC operations as specified. Most TypeScript/ESLint issues encountered during frontend integration were resolved.

**Key Outcomes:**
- Backend PQC configuration loading and API exposure are functional.
- `FavaLedger` modified for PQC encryption/decryption using `BackendCryptoService`.

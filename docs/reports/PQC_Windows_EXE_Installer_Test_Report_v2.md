# Test Report: Fava PQC Windows EXE Installer Re-Test

**Date:** $(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
**Installer Version Tested:** `dist/fava_pqc_windows_installer_v1.1.0.exe` (Rebuilt version)
**Test Plan Document:** [`docs/test-plans/PQC_Windows_EXE_Installer_Test_Plan.md`](../../test-plans/PQC_Windows_EXE_Installer_Test_Plan.md)
**Testing Focus:** Re-execution of tests to verify functionality after a critical bug fix related to `liboqs.dll` and application launch.

## 1. Introduction

This report details the results of re-executing the Python-based test scripts intended to support the verification of the Fava PQC Windows `.exe` installer, version `v1.1.0` (rebuilt). The primary goal was to ascertain if the previously identified application launch issue (due to missing `liboqs.dll`) has been resolved.

The tests were executed by running the Python scripts located in `tests/installation/`. It is important to note that these scripts, in their current form, primarily serve as a framework for guiding manual testing or for integration with UI automation tools. They do not, by themselves, perform the actual installation or uninstallation of the `.exe` installer.

## 2. Test Execution Summary

The following Python test scripts were executed:
-   `tests/installation/test_build.py`
-   `tests/installation/test_installation_flow.py`
-   `tests/installation/test_app_functionality.py`
-   `tests/installation/test_uninstallation.py`

The results reflect the outcome of these script executions. Verification of test cases requiring manual interaction with the installer GUI (e.g., TP-INSTALL-001, TP-APP-001) relies on manual execution of the installer, which was outside the scope of this automated script run.

## 3. Detailed Test Script Results

### 3.1. `tests/installation/test_build.py`
Corresponds to Test Plan section 4.1 (Installer Build Process).

-   **Command:** `python -m unittest tests/installation/test_build.py`
-   **Output:**
    ```
    sFound installer: C:\code\ChrisFava\dist\fava_pqc_windows_installer_v1.1.0.exe
    .
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 2 tests in 0.000s

    OK (skipped=1)
    ```
-   **Summary:**
    -   `test_installer_exe_exists` (TP-BUILD-001 partial): **PASSED**. The script confirmed the existence of `dist/fava_pqc_windows_installer_v1.1.0.exe`.
    -   `test_components_included_placeholder` (TP-BUILD-002): **SKIPPED**. This test is a placeholder requiring manual inspection or specific build tool integration.
-   **AI Verifiable End Result (from Test Plan):** Build process completes, `.exe` generated. (Partially verified by script - `.exe` exists).

### 3.2. `tests/installation/test_installation_flow.py`
Corresponds to Test Plan section 4.2 (Installation Process).

-   **Command:** `python -m unittest tests/installation/test_installation_flow.py`
-   **Output:**
    ```
    s
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 0 tests in 0.000s

    OK (skipped=1)
    ```
-   **Summary:**
    -   All test methods within this script (`test_install_default_path_admin_privileges_placeholder`, `test_install_custom_path_placeholder`, `test_install_user_path_no_admin_placeholder`, `test_shortcuts_created_placeholder` corresponding to TP-INSTALL-001 to TP-INSTALL-004) are placeholders and were **SKIPPED**.
-   **Note:** These tests require manual execution of the installer or UI automation.

### 3.3. `tests/installation/test_app_functionality.py`
Corresponds to Test Plan sections 4.3 (Application Launch & Core Functionality), 4.4 (PQC Feature Functionality), and 4.5 (Dependency Integrity).

-   **Command:** `python -m unittest tests/installation/test_app_functionality.py`
-   **Output:**
    ```
    Warning: Fava executable not found at default test path: C:\Program Files\FavaPQC\fava.exe. Skipping some tests or they might fail.
    Fssssss
    ======================================================================

    AssertionError: False is not true : Fava executable not found at C:\Program Files\FavaPQC\fava.exe

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 7 tests in 0.037s

    FAILED (failures=1, skipped=6)
    ```
-   **Summary:**
    -   `test_app_launch_placeholder` (TP-APP-001, TP-APP-002): **FAILED**. The script could not find `fava.exe` at the expected post-installation path (`C:\Program Files\FavaPQC\fava.exe`). This is an expected outcome as the installer `.exe` was not executed by this automated script run.
    -   Other tests (`test_load_beancount_file_placeholder`, `test_core_report_generation_placeholder`, `test_pqc_feature_functionality_placeholder`, `test_dependency_integrity_python_modules_placeholder`, `test_dependency_integrity_oqs_python_pqc_ops_placeholder`, `test_dependency_integrity_frontend_assets_placeholder` covering TP-APP-003, TP-APP-004, TP-PQC-001 to TP-PQC-004, TP-DEP-001 to TP-DEP-004) were **SKIPPED** as they are placeholders.
-   **Critical Note on Application Launch:** The failure of `test_app_launch_placeholder` **does not** indicate a failure of the rebuilt installer itself. It indicates that the prerequisite for this test (a successfully installed application) was not met because the installer was not run as part of this automated script execution. **Manual testing by running `dist/fava_pqc_windows_installer_v1.1.0.exe` and then attempting to launch the application is required to verify the fix for the application launch issue.**

### 3.4. `tests/installation/test_uninstallation.py`
Corresponds to Test Plan section 4.6 (Uninstallation Process).

-   **Command:** `python -m unittest tests/installation/test_uninstallation.py`
-   **Output:**
    ```
    Warning: Assumed Fava install path 'C:\Program Files\FavaPQC' not found. Uninstallation tests might not be meaningful.
    ss.
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 3 tests in 0.039s

    OK (skipped=2)
    ```
-   **Summary:**
    -   `test_uninstallation_completes_placeholder` (TP-UNINSTALL-001): **SKIPPED** (placeholder, and dependent on prior installation).
    -   `test_shortcuts_removed_placeholder` (TP-UNINSTALL-001): **SKIPPED** (placeholder).
    -   `test_user_data_not_deleted` (TP-UNINSTALL-002): **PASSED** (dummy user data was created by the script and was correctly not found to be deleted, as no uninstallation process actually ran against it).
-   **Note:** These tests are largely placeholders and assume a prior installation and uninstallation cycle, which was not performed by the automated scripts.

## 4. Conclusion and Recommendations

The re-execution of the Python test scripts associated with the Fava PQC Windows installer `v1.1.0` (rebuilt) has been completed.

-   The `test_build.py` script confirmed the presence of the target installer `dist/fava_pqc_windows_installer_v1.1.0.exe`.
-   The `test_installation_flow.py`, `test_app_functionality.py`, and `test_uninstallation.py` scripts largely consist of placeholders that were skipped, which is their designed behavior without manual intervention or UI automation.
-   The **critical test for application launch** (`test_app_launch_placeholder` in `test_app_functionality.py`, corresponding to TP-APP-001/002) **failed within the script execution context**. This failure occurred because the script correctly determined that the Fava application was not installed at the expected location. This is a direct consequence of the automated scripts not performing the installation of the `.exe` file.

**To verify the primary objective of this re-test – confirming that the application launches correctly with the rebuilt installer and that the `liboqs.dll` issue is resolved – the following manual steps are essential, as per the Test Plan:**

1.  **Manually execute the `dist/fava_pqc_windows_installer_v1.1.0.exe` installer** on a clean Windows test environment.
2.  Follow the installation prompts (Test Cases TP-INSTALL-001 to TP-INSTALL-004).
3.  **Attempt to launch the Fava application** from the Start Menu or executable (Test Cases TP-APP-001, TP-APP-002).
4.  Verify core Fava functionality, including loading a Beancount file and viewing reports (Test Cases TP-APP-003, TP-APP-004).
5.  If possible, verify PQC-specific features and dependency integrity (Test Cases TP-PQC-001 to TP-PQC-004, TP-DEP-001 to TP-DEP-004).

The Python scripts did not employ any bad fallbacks; they accurately reflected the state of the system from their perspective (e.g., application not found because it wasn't installed by the scripts).

This report confirms the generation of the test report file as an AI Verifiable End Result. However, it must be stressed that the AI Verifiable End Result concerning the successful pass of critical application launch tests **cannot be confirmed** by these automated script executions alone and requires the manual testing steps outlined above.

# Vitest Execution Diagnosis: PQC WASM Module Integrity

**Target Feature:** PQC WASM Module Integrity Test Environment

**Date:** 2025-06-03

## 1. Problem Description

The `coder-test-driven` worker was unable to execute `vitest` tests for the "PQC WASM Module Integrity" feature. The runner consistently reported "No test files found," and the editor showed "Cannot find module 'vitest'" errors, despite attempts to configure `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and `vitest.config.ts`, and running `npm install`.

## 2. Debugging Steps and Analysis

### 2.1. Reproduction of "No test files found"

*   **Action:** Attempted to run `vitest` using the command `npx vitest run` with the current working directory set to `c:/code/ChrisFava/frontend`.
*   **Initial Observation:** The command failed with the error "No test files found, exiting with code 1".
*   **Clue from Output:** The Vitest output showed: `include: C:/code/ChrisFava/frontend/tests/granular/pqc_wasm_module_integrity/**/*.test.ts`. This indicated that Vitest, when run from the `frontend` directory, was looking for test files within a `tests` subdirectory *inside* `frontend`. However, the actual test files are located at `c:/code/ChrisFava/tests/granular/pqc_wasm_module_integrity/`.

### 2.2. Isolation and Analysis of "No test files found" - `vitest.config.ts`

*   **File Reviewed:** [`frontend/vitest.config.ts`](frontend/vitest.config.ts)
*   **Relevant Section:**
    ```typescript
    include: [
      path.resolve(currentDirname, 'tests/granular/pqc_wasm_module_integrity').replace(/\\/g, '/') + '/**/*.test.ts',
    ],
    ```
    where `currentDirname` is `c:/code/ChrisFava/frontend`.
*   **Root Cause Identified:** The `path.resolve` was constructing the path `c:/code/ChrisFava/frontend/tests/granular/pqc_wasm_module_integrity/**/*.test.ts`. This path is incorrect as the `tests` directory is a sibling of `frontend`, not a child.
*   **Proposed Fix:** Modify the path to go up one level: `path.resolve(currentDirname, '../tests/granular/pqc_wasm_module_integrity')`.

### 2.3. Verification of "No test files found" Fix

*   **Action:** Applied the proposed fix to [`frontend/vitest.config.ts`](frontend/vitest.config.ts).
*   **Result:** Re-ran `npx vitest run` (cwd: `frontend`). Tests were successfully discovered and executed. Some tests failed due to assertion errors in the test logic itself, which is expected and outside the scope of this specific "test execution" debugging task. The primary goal of test discovery was achieved.

    ```

### 2.4. Analysis of "Cannot find module 'vitest'" - `tsconfig.json`

*   **Problem Persisting (Editor Error):** After fixing test discovery, the editor (via TypeScript Language Server) still reported "Cannot find module 'vitest' or its corresponding type declarations" in the test files (e.g., [`tests/granular/pqc_wasm_module_integrity/pqc_verification_service.test.ts`](tests/granular/pqc_wasm_module_integrity/pqc_verification_service.test.ts)).
*   **File Reviewed:** [`frontend/tsconfig.json`](frontend/tsconfig.json)
*   **Relevant Sections:**
    ```json
    "compilerOptions": {
      // ...
      "types": ["node", "vitest/globals"]
      // ...
    },
    "include": [
      "*.ts",
      "src/**/*.ts",
      "src/**/*.svelte",
      "test/**/*.ts", // <--- Problematic path
      "*.config.cjs",
      "*.config.mjs"
    ]
    ```
*   **Root Cause Identified:** The `include` pattern `"test/**/*.ts"` is relative to the location of `tsconfig.json` (which is `frontend/`). Thus, TypeScript was looking for `frontend/test/**/*.ts`. The actual test files are in `tests/granular/...` relative to the project root (`c:/code/ChrisFava`), which is `../tests/granular/...` relative to `frontend/`. TypeScript was not including the actual test files in its compilation context, so the `vitest/globals` types were not being applied to them.
*   **Proposed Fix:** Modify the `include` path from `"test/**/*.ts"` to `"../tests/**/*.ts"`.

### 2.5. Verification of "Cannot find module 'vitest'" Fix

*   **Action:** Applied the proposed fix to [`frontend/tsconfig.json`](frontend/tsconfig.json).
*   **Expected Result:** TypeScript errors related to "Cannot find module 'vitest'" should be resolved in the editor.
*   **Verification Method:** The linter/type-checker output provided by the environment after the `apply_diff` command is used to confirm this. (Note: The actual test run output was already satisfactory after the `vitest.config.ts` fix for test *discovery*).

## 3. Summary of Root Causes

1.  **Incorrect `include` path in `frontend/vitest.config.ts`:** Caused Vitest to look for test files in `frontend/tests/...` instead of `../tests/...` (relative to `frontend`), leading to "No test files found".
2.  **Incorrect `include` path in `frontend/tsconfig.json`:** Caused TypeScript to not recognize the test files in `../tests/...` as part of the project, leading to "Cannot find module 'vitest'" errors in the editor, as Vitest types were not being applied to these files.

## 4. Applied Fixes

1.  **In [`frontend/vitest.config.ts`](frontend/vitest.config.ts):**
    *   Changed line 14 from:
        `path.resolve(currentDirname, 'tests/granular/pqc_wasm_module_integrity').replace(/\\/g, '/') + '/**/*.test.ts',`
    *   To:
        `path.resolve(currentDirname, '../tests/granular/pqc_wasm_module_integrity').replace(/\\/g, '/') + '/**/*.test.ts',`
2.  **In [`frontend/tsconfig.json`](frontend/tsconfig.json):**
    *   Changed line 19 from:
        `"test/**/*.ts",`
    *   To:
        `"../tests/**/*.ts",`

## 5. Outcome of Verification

*   **Test Discovery:** Successfully resolved. Vitest now finds and attempts to run the tests in `tests/granular/pqc_wasm_module_integrity/`.
*   **TypeScript Module Resolution for 'vitest':** Believed to be resolved based on the `tsconfig.json` correction. The absence of "Cannot find module 'vitest'" errors in subsequent linter feedback would confirm this.
*   **Test Failures:** Some tests are still failing (e.g., 8 failed, 8 passed). This is due to issues within the test logic or the code being tested, and is outside the scope of this specific "test execution environment" debugging task. The primary goal was to get the tests *running*.

## 6. Remaining Critical Issues / Recommendations

*   The primary issues ("No test files found" and "Cannot find module 'vitest'") related to test *execution setup* are now addressed.
*   The remaining test failures need to be investigated by the `coder-test-driven` or a similar role responsible for code and test logic implementation.
*   The "Unused '@ts-expect-error' directive" and ESLint `any` type warnings are still present. These are good candidates for a follow-up linting/code quality task but do not block test execution.
*   The Vite CJS Node API deprecation warning (`The CJS build of Vite's Node API is deprecated`) is noted but is unlikely to be the cause of the immediate test execution problems. It could be addressed in a future dependency update/refactor task.

This concludes the diagnosis and resolution of the Vitest test execution issues for the PQC WASM Module Integrity feature.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose
This Master Acceptance Test Plan (MATP) outlines the strategy, scope, resources, and schedule for conducting high-level end-to-end acceptance testing for the Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) integration into the Fava application. The primary goal of this acceptance testing phase is to verify that the PQC-enhanced Fava application meets the specified requirements, functions as expected from a user and system integration perspective, and achieves the overall project goal of protecting data against quantum threats.

This plan is a living document and will be updated as necessary throughout the project lifecycle. It builds upon the findings and strategies outlined in the [`docs/research/PQC_High_Level_Test_Strategy.md`](../../docs/research/PQC_High_Level_Test_Strategy.md).

### 1.2. Project Overview
The project aims to integrate PQC into Fava, focusing on key areas:
*   Data at Rest (encrypted Beancount files)
*   Data in Transit (HTTPS/TLS communication)
*   Data Integrity (hashing mechanisms)
*   WASM Module Integrity (for `tree-sitter-beancount.wasm`)
*   Cryptographic Agility (ability to switch algorithms)

The successful completion of acceptance testing, as defined by this plan, will signify that Fava's PQC integration meets the ultimate success criteria from a user's perspective.

## 2. Overall Testing Approach

### 2.1. Guiding Principles
The acceptance testing approach will adhere to the following principles:
*   **User-Centric:** Tests will simulate real-world user scenarios and system interactions.
*   **End-to-End:** Focus on complete workflows and system integration.
*   **AI Verifiability:** All test cases will include an AI Verifiable End Result (AVER) to enable automated or semi-automated validation.
*   **Risk-Based:** Prioritize testing based on the criticality and risk associated with PQC focus areas.
*   **Specification-Driven:** Test cases will be directly derived from the PQC specification documents ([`docs/specifications/`](../../docs/specifications/)) and the [`docs/research/PQC_High_Level_Test_Strategy.md`](../../docs/research/PQC_High_Level_Test_Strategy.md).
*   **London School TDD Influence:** While these are high-level acceptance tests, the focus remains on behavior and outcomes, aligning with TDD principles.

### 2.2. Test Types
The following types of tests will be employed, as detailed in the [`docs/research/PQC_High_Level_Test_Strategy.md`](../../docs/research/PQC_High_Level_Test_Strategy.md#4-test-types):
*   PQC Functional Tests
*   Security-Focused Scenario Tests
*   Cryptographic Agility Tests
*   Regression Tests (for core Fava functionality with PQC enabled)
*   Basic Performance Indicator Tests
*   Integrity Verification Tests

## 3. Scope of Acceptance Testing

## 9. AI Verifiable End Results (AVERs) Implementation and Tracking

### 9.1. Definition and Principles
An AI Verifiable End Result (AVER) is a concrete, machine-parseable artifact or system state that allows an AI orchestrator or automated test runner to determine the pass/fail status of a test case. AVERs will adhere to the principles outlined in [`docs/research/PQC_High_Level_Test_Strategy.md#71-general-principles-for-avers`](../../docs/research/PQC_High_Level_Test_Strategy.md#71-general-principles-for-avers):
*   **Deterministic:** Consistent for given inputs/actions.
*   **Machine-Parseable:** JSON, specific log patterns, simple string comparisons (e.g., hashes).
*   **Specific:** Clearly indicates success/failure of the tested aspect.
*   **Minimal:** Contains only necessary information for verification.

### 9.2. Implementation in Test Cases
Each high-level acceptance test case document within [`tests/acceptance/`](../../../tests/acceptance/) will explicitly define an "AI Verifiable End Result (AVER)" section. This section will describe the precise condition, output, or state to be checked. Examples include:
*   Specific log messages (e.g., `INFO: Successfully decrypted 'file.pqc' using PQC KEM: KYBER768`).
*   JSON output from an API call matching a known-good snapshot or schema.
*   File content hash matching a pre-calculated value.
*   Presence or absence of specific UI elements (if UI automation is used, though less likely for these high-level tests).
*   Specific HTTP status codes and response body characteristics.

### 9.3. Tracking and Verification
*   During test execution, the actual outcomes corresponding to AVERs will be captured (e.g., log snippets, API responses, calculated hashes).
*   These captured outcomes will be compared against the defined AVERs.
*   An AI agent or test execution script can perform this comparison.
*   Test execution logs will record both the expected AVER and the actual outcome, along with the pass/fail status based on their comparison.

## 10. Reporting and Communication Plan
*   **Defect Tracking:** All defects found during acceptance testing will be logged in a designated defect tracking system with appropriate severity, priority, and steps to reproduce.
*   **Regular Status Updates:** The Test Lead will provide regular (e.g., daily or bi-weekly) status updates to stakeholders, including:
    *   Number of tests executed, passed, failed, blocked.
    *   New defects raised, defect resolution status.
    *   Any risks or issues impacting testing.
*   **Test Phase Completion Reports:** A summary report will be provided at the end of each major test execution cycle.
*   **Final Acceptance Test Summary Report:** Upon completion of all acceptance testing, a comprehensive report will be delivered, detailing the overall results, outstanding defects (if any), and a recommendation for go/no-go.

Communication channels will include regular meetings, email updates, and the defect tracking system.

## 11. Risks and Mitigation
Key risks and mitigation strategies are adapted from [`docs/research/PQC_High_Level_Test_Strategy.md#8-risks-and-mitigation`](../../docs/research/PQC_High_Level_Test_Strategy.md#8-risks-and-mitigation):

| Risk                                      | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                                                               |
| :---------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **PQC Library Instability/Bugs**          | Use stable, well-tested versions. Isolate crypto operations via `CryptoService`. Intensive unit/integration testing by dev team prior to UAT.        |
| **Performance Bottlenecks**               | Basic performance indicators in acceptance tests. Flag gross regressions. Defer deep optimization but ensure usability.                             |
| **Immature PQC Tooling for Test Data**    | Develop helper scripts for test data generation. Rely on core PQC libraries. Allocate time for test data preparation.                               |
| **Complexity of Test Setup/Environment**  | Automate environment setup where possible. Detailed setup documentation. Containerization (e.g., Docker) for consistency.                           |
| **Evolving PQC Standards**                | Focus tests on `CryptoService` abstraction and agility. Prioritize currently NIST-recommended algorithms. Design tests to be adaptable.             |
| **Difficulty in Generating Test Vectors** | Leverage existing vectors from PQC libraries/NIST. Generate end-to-end test data using the chosen PQC libraries.                                      |
| **AI Verifiability Challenges**           | Keep AVERs simple, deterministic, and machine-parseable. Use structured log outputs or API responses. Develop parsing scripts for AVER verification. |
| **Resource Unavailability**               | Identify backup resources. Clear scheduling and communication.                                                                                      |
| **Scope Creep**                           | Adhere strictly to the defined scope in this MATP. Manage changes through a formal change request process.                                        |

This Master Acceptance Test Plan provides the framework for ensuring the PQC integration in Fava is thoroughly validated against user and system requirements, ultimately confirming its readiness and effectiveness.
